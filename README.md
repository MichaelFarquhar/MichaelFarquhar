# Hi there, I'm Michael. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer with 2+ years of experience designing, developing and implementing web apps.

I graduated from the University of Windsor with a B.Sc. Honours Computer Information Systems. Afterwards, I was hired at Digital Media, a local marketing & technology company based in my hometown of Windsor, Ontario. 

At my current place of employment, we create web apps primarily using React, Sass, PHP and MySQL. I have also studied a variety of other web frameworks and languages on my own time.
